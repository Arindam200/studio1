const blogFaqItems: FAQItem[] = [
  {
    question: "What types of technical content do you create?",
    answer:
      "We create developer-focused blog posts, step-by-step tutorials, integration guides, product walkthroughs, comparison articles, technical deep-dives, and campaign content built around real projects or repos. Every piece includes real technical context and is written by engineers or technical writers matched to the stack.",
  },
  {
    question: "Who writes the blog posts?",
    answer:
      "Our writers are experienced engineers and technical writers with backgrounds in AI/ML, DevOps, cloud computing, web development, and more. Each writer is matched to your product's stack so the content reads like it was written by someone on your team.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is the typical turnaround time per blog post?",
    answer:
      "Most straightforward blogs and tutorials can move from brief to draft in 3 to 7 days. Complex technical deep dives, product walkthroughs, or code-heavy implementation guides usually need 10 to 14 days for research, validation, review, and polish.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can you help repurpose content after publishing?",
    answer:
      "Yes, when it fits the engagement. We can adapt a published article into short social copy, developer-community snippets, or republishing formats for approved channels like Dev.to, Medium, X, and LinkedIn.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do you ensure technical accuracy?",
    answer:
      "Every article goes through a multi-step review process: the writer validates code examples, a technical reviewer checks accuracy and edge cases, and an editor ensures clarity. We also incorporate your team's feedback before publish.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I provide topics or do you handle topic selection?",
    answer:
      "Both. We can work from your content calendar, or research and propose topics based on keyword data, competitor analysis, developer pain points, and your product roadmap. Most clients prefer a hybrid approach where Studio1 suggests topics and the client approves.",
  },
  {
    question: "What does the review workflow look like?",
    answer:
      "We usually start with a topic, then send an outline and overview for approval. After your team approves the direction, we write the draft, review it internally, send it for client review, revise, and then publish on the agreed channel.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can content publish from Studio1 or individual author profiles?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Depending on the goal, content can publish on your company blog, your Dev.to or Medium profile, Studio1 profiles, or individual author profiles. We also support social posts from either your channels or ours when that fits the campaign.",
