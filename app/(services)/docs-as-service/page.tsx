  {
    question: "What do Developer Documentation & DX Audit Services include?",
    answer:
      "Four connected workstreams: editing existing documentation, writing missing documentation from scratch, docs audits, and developer experience audits across docs, APIs, SDKs, onboarding, dashboards, and developer-facing product surfaces. You can start with any one or run them together.",
  },
  {
    question: "What does a docs audit deliver?",
    answer:
      "A findings report with prioritized friction points, evidence from walking the product as a new developer, and a practical roadmap for what to write, rewrite, or improve first. The goal is faster time-to-first-success.",
  },
  {
    question: "Who writes the documentation?",
    answer:
      "Engineers and technical writers matched to your stack. Every page includes real code examples, goes through technical review, and incorporates your team's feedback before it is considered done.",
  },
  {
    question: "What counts as a DX improvement?",
    answer:
      "Anything that shortens or clarifies the path to first success: clearer onboarding, API key setup, SDK examples, docs navigation, dashboard flows, playground behavior, error states, developer-facing landing-page clarity, and follow-up reviews tied to activation signals.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you do landing page copywriting?",
    answer:
      "Not as a pure marketing copywriting service. We review landing pages from the developer perspective: whether the product is technically clear, whether docs and SDK paths are easy to find, and whether the path from interest to first request makes sense.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can you work inside our existing docs site?",
    answer:
      "Yes. We write for Mintlify, Docusaurus, GitBook, custom Next.js docs, and similar setups. We match your information architecture and contribution process rather than forcing a new tool.",
  },
  {
    question: "How is this different from technical content marketing?",
    answer:
      "Blog content is for discovery on the open web. Docs are product surfaces: onboarding, reference, and task completion. We treat them as product work with activation and support metrics, not just traffic.",
  },
  {
    question: "How long does an engagement take?",
    answer:
      "A focused docs audit typically lands in 2 to 3 weeks. Documentation and DX improvements then ship against the roadmap on a steady cadence. Scope depends on product surface area.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do you measure success?",
    answer:
      "We look at time-to-first-success, docs usefulness and search, support ticket themes, and activation steps tied to documented flows. Reports stay tied to the friction you asked us to remove.",
