Using Studio1’s launch framing, creator amplification, and developer-first content,
Pieces Copilot+ earned Product Hunt “Product of the Day.” We orchestrated
coordinated creator posts, hands-on tutorials, and targeted community outreach to
drive high-quality engagement and post-day momentum.

## Testimonial

<Card title="Client feedback" icon="">
  "Arindam delivered a masterclass on launching on Product Hunt. We placed 3rd
  on our first launch with almost no preparation. He writes technical content
  that reaches engaged developers — we’ll definitely work with him again."
