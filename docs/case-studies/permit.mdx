Studio1 partnered with **Permit.io** to design and execute a technical content and distribution program that delivered two outcomes simultaneously:

* First-page Google rankings for high-intent authorization queries
* Increased qualified developer traffic to Permit.io’s product education and implementation pages

The engagement also extended into **distribution and launch support**, including community amplification and alignment with Permit.io’s **Product Hunt motion**.

## What is Permit.io?

<Frame>![Permit](/images/permit-page.png)</Frame>

[**Permit.io**](https://dub.sh/permit) is a developer-first authorization platform that helps engineering teams implement and manage permissions such as RBAC, ABAC, and policy-based access control, across modern application stacks.

For Permit.io, content is not just marketing. Their blog and learning resources act as a **primary acquisition channel**, because developers actively search for concrete implementation answers such as *“RBAC in Supabase”* or *“authorization vs authentication.”*

Winning these searches meant combining strong SEO fundamentals with deeply practical, product-aligned guides.

## The challenge

Permit.io needed content that could perform on two fronts:

* **Growth-oriented content** that increases discoverability, earns backlinks, and captures early-stage developer interest.
* **Deep technical implementation guides** that rank for high-intent queries and convert readers into product users through real, hands-on workflows.

In parallel, the team wanted support activating **distribution channels** (such as Dev.to) and coordinating execution around their **Product Hunt launch**.

## What Studio1 delivered

Studio1HQ built and executed a **two-track content engine** designed for both ranking and product adoption.

### 1. Growth content (SEO + backlinks)

We produced growth-focused articles designed to capture broader search intent and earn natural backlinks.

Key elements:

* SEO-driven topic selection focused on discoverability and link potential
* Editorial framing that made articles easy to reference and share
* Clear positioning that introduced Permit.io early in the developer journey

### 2. Technical implementation guides (rank + activate)

Alongside growth content, Studio1HQ created **step-by-step technical guides** mapped directly to Permit.io use cases and real developer workflows.

A standout example is: **“How to Implement RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) in Supabase”**

<Frame>![Permit Blog](/images/permit-blogs.png)</Frame>

Why this guide performs:

* It clearly distinguishes **authentication vs authorization**, then explains why RBAC is a scalable foundation.
* It walks through a complete RBAC setup using Permit.io concepts such as roles, resources, actions, tenants, and policies.
* It shows real enforcement using **Supabase Edge Functions**, including a permission-check endpoint powered by Permit’s `check` flow.

The result is content that doesn’t just rank, it actively teaches developers how to adopt the product.

### 3. Ghostwriting and editorial execution

Studio1HQ supported Permit.io with **ghostwritten content** while preserving the company’s technical voice and standards.

Each piece was:

* Technically accurate and reviewed for correctness
* Structured for developer readability
* Aligned with Permit.io’s documentation and product terminology


## Distribution: Dev.to, Medium and community reach

To extend the lifecycle of each asset, Studio1 supported **content distribution beyond the Permit.io blog**.

This included repurposing and syndicating posts across developer platforms such as **Dev.to**, **Medium**, helping:

* Reach new developer audiences
* Capture incremental traffic beyond search
* Reinforce Permit.io’s positioning in the broader dev community

## Product Hunt support

Studio1HQ also supported Permit.io’s **Product Hunt launch**, focusing on execution that maximized day-of visibility, engagement, and traffic.

Permit.io has publicly documented its launch strategy and outcomes, including achieving **Product of the Day** and the resulting traffic and sign-ups.
