Studio1 partnered with **ScrapeGraph AI** to run a full-stack growth campaign across content, community, and product—focused on increasing awareness, driving real developer usage, and improving the onboarding experience.

The campaign combined **multi-channel distribution**, **hands-on AI agent projects**, **event activation**, and **product feedback loops** to position ScrapeGraph AI as a practical, production-ready tool for building AI-powered scraping and research workflows.

Key outcomes included:

- ~265K+ total reach across social and community platforms
- Strong inbound discussions from Reddit and X
- Real-world adoption driven by four concrete AI agent examples
- Product and documentation improvements aligned with ICP needs

## What is ScrapeGraph AI?

<Frame>![ScrapeGraph Product](/images/scrapegraph-landing.png)</Frame>

[**ScrapeGraph AI**](https://dub.sh/scrapegraph) is a developer-first AI scraping and data extraction platform that enables teams to build intelligent agents for web research, structured data collection, and automation.

It provides:

- AI-powered web scraping
- Structured data extraction
- Browser automation
- API-based access to scraped data

## The challenge

ScrapeGraph AI wanted to:

- Increase **awareness and reach** across developer communities.
- Show **real, practical use-cases** instead of abstract feature marketing.
- Drive **hands-on adoption** of their SDK and APIs.
- Improve **onboarding, docs, and product experience** for new users.
- Strengthen positioning with their ideal ICP (AI engineers, founders, agent builders).

They needed not just content, but a **campaign that connects product, community, and real developer workflows**.

## What Studio1 delivered

Studio1 executed a full growth campaign across **content, social, community, events, and product feedback**.

### 1. Multi-channel distribution campaign

We launched ScrapeGraph AI content across major developer surfaces:

**Reach summary:**

- YouTube + Newsletter: **4.8K+**
- Twitter (X) + LinkedIn: **90K+**
- Reddit: **~170K+**

This ensured ScrapeGraph AI showed up where developers already consume technical content and discover new tools.

### 2. Four real AI agent examples (use-case driven)

Instead of generic demos, Studio1 built **four concrete AI agent projects** focused on ScrapeGraph AI’s real-world use-cases.

These examples showcased how ScrapeGraph can be used for:

- Deep research agents
- Price and data monitoring
- Structured extraction pipelines
- AI-powered discovery workflows

Each project was designed to answer one question clearly:  
**“How would a real developer actually use this in production?”**

### 3. Social launches on X and Reddit

All projects were launched on **X (Twitter)** and shared across Reddit with high-signal posts explaining:

- The problem being solved
- The agent architecture
- Why ScrapeGraph AI fits the use-case
- Practical implementation insights

These posts generated strong inbound engagement and organic discussions.

### 4. Visual illustrations and explainers

To make complex agent concepts easier to grasp, Studio1 created **visual illustrations and GIFs** explaining:

- Agent flows
- Data pipelines
- ScrapeGraph’s role inside the system

This significantly increased comprehension and shareability of the content.

### 5. Community activation: Hyderabad AI event

Studio1 also showcased ScrapeGraph AI at a **developer event in Hyderabad, India**, sparking in-person conversations and deeper technical discussions.

This helped ScrapeGraph AI connect directly with builders and founders working on AI agents and data pipelines.

### 6. Product, onboarding, and docs feedback

Beyond content, Studio1 worked as a product growth partner, helping ScrapeGraph AI improve key parts of their product, onboarding, and developer experience based on real usage.

We supported improvements across:

- Onboarding & activation: clearer first-time flows, better credit visibility, and smoother setup experience
- Documentation & learning: more use-case-driven docs, practical SDK examples, and clearer workflows
- Product & playground UX: UI refinements, better error handling, and more intuitive testing experience
- Growth mechanics: stronger free tier, credit-based activation loops, and clearer product messaging

All insights were shared as a structured product and DevEx audit, aligned to how real developers discover, test, and adopt ScrapeGraph AI.

## Results

The campaign resulted in:

- Large-scale multi-channel visibility across developer ecosystems
- High-signal technical discussions driven by real projects
- Strong inbound interest from AI engineers and founders
- Clearer product positioning around real-world use-cases
- Actionable improvements to onboarding, docs, and UX

Instead of vanity metrics, the focus was on **real developer adoption, product clarity, and long-term growth foundations**.

## Want similar results?

Studio1 helps AI, devtool, and SaaS companies run **end-to-end growth campaigns**,from technical content and community distribution to real product adoption and onboarding optimization.

If you want more than just content and need real developer traction, Studio1 can design a similar **multi-channel, product-led campaign** for your product.

Share your ICP and growth goals, and we’ll map a campaign that actually compounds.
